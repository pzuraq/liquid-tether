# Liquid Tether

Liquid Tether combines the ideas behind
[Ember Tether](https://github.com/yapplabs/ember-tether.git) with the power of
[Liquid Fire](http://ef4.github.io/liquid-fire/) to provide an accessible,
easy-to-use toolkit for both positioning & animating UI elements.

Interactive documentation can be found
[here](http://pzuraq.github.io/liquid-tether/).

## Ember Compatibility

Liquid Tether has only been tested on Ember 1.13. Testing for newer versions of
Ember is on the roadmap. Older versions are not currently on the roadmap.

## Installation

ember install liquid-tether
```
